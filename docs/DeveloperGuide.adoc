By: `CS2103-F11-B1`      Since: `Jan 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the CRM Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the CRM Book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::remark[]
=== Remark feature
==== Current Implementation

To record more detailed information of a person, a new command `RemarkCommand` is implemented.

The `RemarkCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommands` since it is reasonable to make remark command execute in an _undoable_ way.

`RemarkCommand` which is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class RemarkCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... remark logic ...
    }
}
----
The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for `RemarkCommand`.

image::RemarkCommandDiagram.png[width="300"]

The model `Person` is modified to have a new field `Remark`.

The default value of the remark field of a person is an empty string.
A user is not able to assign a remark to a person when adding the person. Therefore, all people in the CRM Book is originally without any remark by default.

The implementation of this command is much like the `EditCommand`.
For example, when a user type `remark 2 r\Likes to swim`. Then the remark field of the 2nd person in the current list will be changed to `Likes to swim`. It’s similar to editing a person’s phone number or address.

The sequence diagram is shown below:

image::RemarkCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `RemarkCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new `remark` command
** Pros: Treat it as a command may be easy to understand. Only a few people needs a remark.
** Cons: Cannot add a person with remark.
* **Alternative 2:** Just make it a part of `EditCommand` and `AddCommand`
** Pros: Only need to add remark field to every related class. We can add a person with remark.
** Cons: We may have to type too many things when adding a person. Also, some people don’t have any remark.
// end::remark[]

// tag::colortag[]
=== Color Tag feature
==== Current Implementation

To allow easy identification of different tags, a color tag feature is introduced.

A string array is declared in PersonCard.java to include a set of colors for tags.
[source,java]
----
//In PersonCard.java
private static final String[] TAG_COLORS =
        { "blue", "cyan", "green", "magenta", "orange", "pink", "red", "yellow", "teal", "brown" };
----

These colors are defined, with their background color and text color spelled out, in the all the different theme CSS files.

A hash code of the tag name is used to select a color for the tag such that it would remain consistent between different runs of the software.
[source,java]
----
//In PersonCard.java
private String getTagColorFor(String tagName) {
    return TAG_COLORS[Math.abs(tagName.hashCode()) % TAG_COLORS.length];
}

//In PersonCard.java
private void initTags(Person person) {
    person.getTags().forEach(tag -> {
        Label tagLabel = new Label(tag.tagName);
        tagLabel.getStyleClass().add(getTagColorFor(tag.tagName));
        tags.getChildren().add(tagLabel);
    });
}
----
==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of color tags

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Assign a color from a predefined list based on tag name
** Pros: No additional commands are needed to generate a color for the tags.
** Cons: User cannot choose a color for the tag.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow user to set a color for the tag
** Pros: Allows more freedom for user customization.
** Cons: Takes more time to implement color tags.
// end::colortag[]

// tag::autocomplete[]
=== Auto-Complete feature
==== Current Implementation

To allow fast typing of commands, auto-complete of commands is implemented.

Auto-complete is implemented through the TextFields feature of ControlsFX.
[source,java]
----
//In CommandBox.java
TextFields.bindAutoCompletion(commandTextField, Messages.AUTOCOMPLETE_FIELD);
----
All the command keywords are included in the AUTOCOMPLETE_FIELD string array.
[source,java]
----
//In Messages.java
public static final String[] AUTOCOMPLETE_FIELD = {
    //all command keywords
    };
----
In addition to all the command keywords, a COMMAND_AUTO_COMPLETE string, with both command word and prefixes, is also included for add command.
[source,java]
----
//In AddCommand.java
public static final String COMMAND_AUTO_COMPLETE = COMMAND_WORD + " " + PREFIX_NAME + " "
        + PREFIX_PHONE + " " + PREFIX_EMAIL + " " + PREFIX_ADDRESS + " " + PREFIX_TAG;
----
==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of Auto-complete

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** All the commands that contain the typed input are shown. ie. When "a" is typed, both "add" and "clear" will be shown.
** Pros: Allow new user to quickly learn the different command words.
** Cons: When there are a lot of commands, efficiency of auto-complete decreases as user would have too many options to choose from.
* **Alternative 2:** Only commands with the same sequence as the typed input are shown. ie. When "a" is typed, only "add" will be shown.
** Pros: Higher efficiency of auto-complete.
** Cons: New user might find this difficult to use as they are unfamillar with the command words.
// end::autocomplete[]

// tag::leadcontact[]
=== Leads and Contacts feature
==== Current Implementation

People in the address book were stored under a single class with no options for differentiating between two types of classes.

To implement a CRM Book, Leads and Contacts must be differentiated so that they can each hold different fields like a proper CRM Book. To do so, they currently extend the Person class so that all existing functionality associated with Persons will work with both Leads an Contacts. Unique fields will be given their own classes like the original generic fields like Name and Address.

In a CRM Book, users start by adding Leads, who are people they have not sold to yet. As they begin selling, the people who they have sold to become Contacts.

Many existing commands like `AddCommand` have been modified to fit the new paradigm so that it only adds Leads.

A new conversion command `ConvertCommand` has been added to convert Leads into Contacts. The Sequence Diagram is shown:

image::ConvertSequenceDiagram1.png[width="650"]

The `ConvertCommand` class calls the `convertPerson method` in the `ModelManager` class and the Sequence Diagram for the resulting steps are shown below.

image::ConvertSequenceDiagram2.png[width="650"]

When the user has selected a Contact instead of a Lead, an error is thrown with this code:

[source,java]
----
public class ConvertCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    protected void preprocessUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        // ... get list of Persons ...
        try {
            oldLead = (Lead) lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());
        } catch (ClassCastException cce) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_NOT_CONVERTED);
        }
        newContact = createContact(oldLead);
    }
}
----

It keeps the name, phone, email, address, remarks and tags through the conversion. The company is converted if it exists into an Account. The converted date is set in the Contact.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of Leads and Contacts

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extend the existing Person class
** Pros: We will not lose any functionality associated with the Person class.
** Cons: Declarations of Person variables may confuse new developers even as a general class for Leads and Contacts.
* **Alternative 2:** Create two new classes Leads and Contacts
** Pros: Clearly differentiates Leads and Contacts throughout the codebase.
** Cons: We would have to rewrite most objects to take into account the two new classes.


===== Aspect: How conversion will work

* **Alternative 1:** Just convert the basic information. Let user fill in other fields themselves.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: User must do extra work.
* **Alternative 2:** Smartly detect which fields can be converted and then do so.
** Pros: User will only need to fix some mistakes in the conversion.
** Cons: Smart detection and conversion needs work to do.
// end::leadcontact[]

// tag::linkedinlogin[]
=== LinkedIn Login Feature
==== Current Implementation

The linkedInLogin mechanism is handled largely by the oAuth2Client interacting with the browser window, which the user will interact with in order to give LinkedIn their username, password, as well as granting the application permission for use.

When the `linkedIn_login` command is called, a `ShowBrowserRequestEvent` will be fired by `LinkedInLoginCommand(Class)` and picked up by the MainWindow.

[source,java]
@Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowBrowserRequestEvent());
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
    }

The MainWindow in turn will call the `OAuth2Client(Class)` which will fire up the browser awaiting an authorization code from LinkedIn that will be sent after the user has successfully logged in and granted the CRM Book permission.

[source, java]
@Subscribe
    private void handleLinkedInAuthenticationEvent(ShowBrowserRequestEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        handleLinkedInAuthentication();
    }

[source, java]
public void handleLinkedInAuthentication() {
    try {
        Oauth2Client.authenticateWithLinkedIn(config);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}

[source, java]
public static void authenticateWithLinkedIn(Config configuration) throws IOException {
    ...
    String urlString = "https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?response_type=code&client_id="
        + clientId + "&redirect_uri=" + redirectUri + "&state=...";
    bWindow = new BrowserWindow(urlString);
    bWindow.show();
}

Once this has happened, we fire a `HideBrowserRequestEvent` in order to close the browser properly.

The `Decrypter` will then be fired so that we do not store the app secret in plain text. This decision is explained more in the design considerations below.

[source, java]
public void handleHideBrowser() {
    Oauth2Client.closeBrowser();
    Oauth2Client.getLinkedInS();
}

After the CRM Book has received the authorization code and the app secret from the decrypter, they are sent back to LinkedIn to request for an AccessToken. Once the AccessToken has been received, the user is considered to be successfully logged in, and the accessToken can be used by the CRM Book to make requests to LinkedIn on behalf of the user. The accessToken is also stored in the config.json file for future usage.

[source, java]
config.setAppSecret(accessToken);
ConfigUtil.saveConfig(config, config.DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE);

The following sequence diagram shows how the linkedIn_login feature works. As seen, it is an events-driven design.

image::LinkedInLoginSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Storing the LinkedIn App Secret

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Slightly encrypting the App Secret
** Pros: Easy to implement, not trivial for attackers to get by scanning the source code.
** Cons: App secret can be derived if the attacker runs the source code
* **Alternative 2:** Store the App Secret in another server, and requesting it with an authentication code
** Pros: Higher security, app secret not stored on GitHub
** Cons: Significantly harder to implement. Requires user to have a username and password for the server not stored on GitHub.
**Additional Info:** See comments on Decrypter class for full argument
// end::linkedinlogin[]

// tag::bulkimport[]
=== Bulk Import Feature
==== Current Implementation

To add a large number of persons to the CRM Book at the same time, a new command `ImportCommand` is implemented.

The `ImportCommand` inherits from `Command`. It is implemented this way:
[source, java]
----
public class ImportCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // … import logic …
    }
}
----

When an `ImportCommand` is called, the corresponding CSV file will be processed. Then persons will be added to CRM Book automatically like what a `AddCommand` can do but without manual typing.

The sequence diagram is shown below:

image::ImportCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: CSV file format

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Requires the CSV file to follow the given format
** Pros: Easy to implement. No need to analyze too much about the file.
** Cons: More work for users.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow attributes not in order and allow different names for attributes
** Pros: Hard to detect and implement.
** Cons: More flexible to users. Can help users save time.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::alias[]
=== Alias Commands feature
==== Current Implementation

A command can be performed by typing in its alias rather than the word. +
The following is an example of implementing the alias command for the list command: +
[source, java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {

    public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "list";
    //@@author Sheikh-Umar
    public static final String COMMAND_ALIAS = "l";
    //@@author

    public static final String MESSAGE_SUCCESS = "Listed all Leads and Contacts";


    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        model.updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
    }
}
----

The alias command for all other commands will follow a similar implementation. +

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to implement the alias command for all commands
The feature is implemented by adding the alias of the command into its respective java document, and updating the AddressBookParser java document. +
The feature is implemented this way to utilise the command java documents that are available as opposed to creating a new java document for a certain alias. +

This feature is implemented to allow a user to enter a command without specifying the entire word of the command. +
// end::alias[]

// tag::duplicate[]
=== Identifying a Duplicate feature
==== Current Implementation
The CRM Book will ensure that every Lead and Contact stored is a non-duplicate. +

The feature is implemented by checking the phone number and email address of a new Lead with all of the phone numbers and email addresses of all leads and contacts currently in the CRM-Book. +

The feature will be implemented on the add command because the current application detects duplicates at the add command. +
The following is how the feature will be implemented: +
[source, java]
----
public boolean contains(Person toCheck) {
        requireNonNull(toCheck);
        for (int i = 0; i < internalList.size(); i++) {
            Person current = internalList.get(i);
            if (current.getPhone().equals(toCheck.getPhone())
                    || current.getEmail().equals(toCheck.getEmail())) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
----

The phone number and email address of a Lead will be checked in the list of all Leads and Contacts.
If either the phone number of email address of the Lead to be added is found in the list,
the CRM application will display a message that the lead is a duplicate and will reject this lead.

The following activity diagram shows how the operation of identifying a duplicate lead works:

image::DetectDuplicateActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to implement identifying a duplicate
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterate through all Leads and Contacts in CRM-Book.
** Pros: Search will be performed in linear time, and enhances an existing portion of code.
// end::duplicate[]

// tag::addparentcompanytag[]
=== Adding a Parent Company tag feature [Coming in v2.0]
==== Current Implementation
It is possible that the user may want to keep track of the companies associated with the Leads and Contacts in the CRM Book.
For example, Skype and Nokia are two different companies whose parent company is Microsoft.
Hence, every Lead and Contact will have an additional tag named after the parent company if their company has a parent company.
The following activity diagram illustrates how this will be implemented:

image::AddParentCompanyTagActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How adding a Parent Company tag feature works
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** If the user updated the Company of a Lead or Contact, the CRM Book determines if this company has a parent company using a Google search.
If yes, it automatically adds a tag to this Lead or Contact labelled as the parent company of the company of the Lead or Contact.
// end::addparentcompanytag[]

// tag::display[]
=== Displaying Lead list and Contact list feature
==== Current Implementation
The CRM Book will be able to list out all Leads and Contacts separately.

The feature is implemented by checking on the type of the persons already stored in the CRM, and displaying all persons that match the keyword (either Lead or Contact) that the user enters. +

The feature is implemented through the DisplayCommand, which is based on FindCommand.
Hence, the DisplayCommand will operate similarly as the FindCommand, with the only difference being the DisplayCommand searches for all Leads or Contacts already in the CRM Book. +

The `DisplayCommand` inherits from `Command`. It is implemented this way:
[source, java]
----
public class DisplayCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // … import logic …
    }
}
----

The following activity diagram shows how the operation of displaying the Leads or Contacts list works:

image::DisplayListOfACertainTypeActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How displaying Lead list and Contact list works

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterate through the CRM Book for persons that match the keyword that user entered just like the FindCommand.
** Pros: Iteration will be performed in linear time, and utilises the functionality of the FindCommand.
// end::display[]

// tag::findbyphonenumberandemailaddress[]
=== Enhancement of Find Command feature
==== Reason for Implementation
The user may want to search for Leads and Contacts based on phone numbers and email addresses rather than names.

==== Current Implementation
The CRM Book currently searches for a Lead or Contact based on their name.

This command can be further improved by being able to find phone numbers and email addresses. +

The following is how the feature will be implemented:
[source, java]
----
public boolean test(Person person) {
         return keywords.stream().anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, keyword)                .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, keyword)
                        || StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getPhone().value, keyword)
                        || StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getEmail().value, keyword));
     }
 }
----

The phone number and email address that the user entered will be checked in the list of all Leads and Contacts.
If either the phone number of email address is found in the list,
the CRM Book will display the Leads and/or Contacts that match the keywords entered.
If not, the CRM Book will display zero Leads and Contacts found.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to implement finding phone numbers and email addresses
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Edit the current search implementation to include finding phone numbers and email addresses.
** Pros: Search will be performed in linear time, and utilises an existing portion of code.
// end::findbyphonenumberandemailaddress[]

// tag::changeTheme[]
=== Change Theme feature
==== Reason for implementation
CRM Book users are expected to spent long period of time on the software and under different light settings. Change theme allows users to switch between light and dark theme. This would prevent eye fatigue.

==== Current implementation
The sequence diagram below shows the interactions of change theme command within the logic component.

image::ChangeThemeLogicComponentSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions between different components of CRM Book for change theme command.

image::ChangeThemeHighLevelSequenceDiagrams.png[width="800"]

Every change theme command will post a ChangeThemeRequestEvent to EventCenter. When this event is handled, the UI will be updated to display the chosen theme. In addition, the themeFilePath in user prefs is updated with the chosen theme file path.
Currently, there are three themes, namely blue, light and dark. The CSS files of these themes are referenced in Theme class as strings.
The following piece of code demonstrates how the CSS files are referenced in Theme class:
----
//in Theme.java
    public static final String DEFAULT_THEME_FILE_PATH = "/view/BlueTheme.css";
    public static final String DARK_THEME_FILE_PATH = "/view/DarkTheme.css";
    public static final String LIGHT_THEME_FILE_PATH = "/view/LightTheme.css";
----

There is a method in Theme class to convert theme name into theme file path.
----
//in Theme.java
    public String convertThemeToFilePath() {
            switch (this.theme) {
            case DARK_THEME:
                return DARK_THEME_FILE_PATH;
            //other cases
            }
        }
----
This method is used to check if the chosen theme is equals to the current theme by comparing the file path of the chosen theme with the file path in user prefs.

If the chosen theme is not equals to the current theme, the ChangeThemeRequestEvent will be handle in MainWindow class.
----
//in MainWindow.java
public void handleChangeTheme(String theme) {
        String fullPath = getFullPath(this.themeFilePath);
        primaryStage.getScene().getStylesheets().remove(fullPath);

        switch (theme) {
        case Theme.LIGHT_THEME:
            this.themeFilePath = Theme.LIGHT_THEME_FILE_PATH;
            break;
        case Theme.DARK_THEME:
            this.themeFilePath = Theme.DARK_THEME_FILE_PATH;
            break;
        case Theme.BLUE_THEME:
            this.themeFilePath = Theme.BLUE_THEME_FILE_PATH;
            break;
        default:
            //this will not happen
        }

        prefs.getGuiSettings().setThemeFilePath(this.themeFilePath);
        fullPath = getFullPath(this.themeFilePath);
        primaryStage.getScene().getStylesheets().add(fullPath);
    }
----
This method updates the theme file path in the primary scene in 3 steps: +

. Removes the current theme file path from primary scene.
. Updates the theme file path
. Adds the new theme file path into primary scene.

In addition, the updated theme file path is written into user prefs. +

A switch case statement is used to update the new theme file path. This implementation allows easy extension of the feature; i.e. when a new theme is created, it can be easily added as a case.

// end::changeTheme[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-before.png[width="200"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.
****

. Modify the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to show the total number of people in the address book.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-before.png[width="500"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594[PR] for the full solution.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
