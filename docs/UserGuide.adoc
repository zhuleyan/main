== Introduction
//tag::description[]
CRM Book application aims to assist salespeople in managing the information of Leads and Contacts more optimally for future sales decisions.
Leads are people that salespeople want to sell to. Contacts are people that salespeople have sold to.

Unique features of this application include identifying if a Lead to be added in is a duplicate,
scheduling appointments with Leads through the Calander, converting a Lead to a Contact after a sales transaction, and integrating LinkedIn to allow
a salesperson to know if one of their Contacts changed companies.
*More importantly, CRM Book is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast,
CRM Book can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
